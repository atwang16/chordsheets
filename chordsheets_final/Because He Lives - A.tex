God sent His \c{A}Son, they called Him \c{D}Jesus;

He came to \c{A}love, heal and for\c{E}give; \c{E7}

He lived and \c{A}died \c{A7} to buy my \c{D}pardon,

An empty \c{A}grave is there to \c{E}prove my Savior \c{A}lives!
\ev

\bc
\c{A}Because He lives\c{A7}, I can face to\c{D}morrow,

Because He \c{A}lives, all fear is \c{E}gone;

Because I \c{A/E D A}know He holds the \c{D}future,

And life is \c{A}worth the living \c{E}just because He \c{A}lives!
\ec

\bv
How sweet to \c{A}hold a newborn \c{D}baby,

And feel the \c{A}pride and joy he \c{E}gives; \c{E7}

But greater st\c{A}ill \c{A7} the calm as\c{D}surance:

\fit{This child can \c{A}face uncertain \c{E}days because He \c{A} lives!}
\ev

\rc{1}

\bv
And then one \c{A}day, I'll cross the \c{D}river,

I'll fight life's f\c{A}inal war with \c{E}pain; \c{E7}

And then, as \c{A}death \c{A7} gives way to \c{D}vict'ry,

I'll see the \c{A}lights of glory \c{E}and I'll know He \c{A}lives!
