\bc
I saw the light, I saw the light

No more darkness, no more night

Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight

Praise the Lord, I saw the light
\ec

\bv
I've wandered so aimless, life filled with sin

I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in

Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night

Praise the Lord, I saw the light
\ev

\rc{1}

\bv
Just like a blind man I wandered alone

Worries and fear I claimed for my own

Then like a blind man who God gave back his sight

Praise the Lord, I saw the light
\ev

\rc{1}

\bv
I was a fool to wander and stray

For straight is the gate and narrow the way

Now I have traded the wrong for the right

Praise the Lord I saw the light.
\ev

\rc{1}

\bv
\fit{Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away}

To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away
\ev

\bc
I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away

When I die, hallelujah, by and by I'll fly away
\ec

\bv
\fit{When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away}

\fit{Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away}
\ev

\rc{2}

\bv
Just a few more weary days, and then, I'll fly away

To a land where joys shall never end, I'll fly away
\ev
