He's \c{A}coming on the clouds

Kings and kingdoms \c{Bm}will bow \c{D}down

\c{F\s m}Every chain will break

As \c{E}broken hearts declare His \c{D}praise

For who can stop the \c{E}Lord almighty?

\c{A} Our God is the Lion, the \c{E/G\s }Lion of \c{F\s m}Judah

Heâ€™s roaring with power and \c{E}fighting our b\c{D}attles

Every knee will \c{E}bow before Him

\c{A} Our God is the Lamb, the \c{E/G\s }Lamb that was \c{F\s m}slain

\fit{For the sins of the world, His \c{E}blood breaks the \c{D}chains}

Every knee will \c{E}bow before the Lion and the \c{D}Lamb

Every knee will \c{E}bow before Him
