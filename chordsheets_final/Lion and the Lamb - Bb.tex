He's \c{Bb}coming on the clouds

Kings and kingdoms \c{Cm}will bow \c{Eb}down

\c{Gm}Every chain will break

As \c{F}broken hearts declare His \c{Eb}praise

For who can stop the \c{F}Lord almighty?

\c{Bb} Our God is the Lion, the \c{F/A}Lion of \c{Gm}Judah

Heâ€™s roaring with power and \c{F}fighting our b\c{Eb}attles

Every knee will \c{F}bow before Him

\c{Bb} Our God is the Lamb, the \c{F/A}Lamb that was \c{Gm}slain

\fit{For the sins of the world, His \c{F}blood breaks the \c{Eb}chains}

Every knee will \c{F}bow before the Lion and the \c{Eb}Lamb

Every knee will \c{F}bow before Him
