He's \c{C}coming on the clouds

Kings and kingdoms \c{Dm}will bow \c{F}down

\c{Am}Every chain will break

As \c{G}broken hearts declare His \c{F}praise

For who can stop the \c{G}Lord almighty?

\c{C} Our God is the Lion, the \c{G/B}Lion of \c{Am}Judah

Heâ€™s roaring with power and \c{G}fighting our b\c{F}attles

Every knee will \c{G}bow before Him

\c{C} Our God is the Lamb, the \c{G/B}Lamb that was \c{Am}slain

\fit{For the sins of the world, His \c{G}blood breaks the \c{F}chains}

Every knee will \c{G}bow before the Lion and the \c{F}Lamb

Every knee will \c{G}bow before Him
