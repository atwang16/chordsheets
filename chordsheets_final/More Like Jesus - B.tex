You \c{B}came to the world You created

\c{E}Trading Your crown for a cross

You \c{G\s m}willingly died

Your \c{F\s }innocent life paid the \c{E}cost
\ev

\bv
\c{B}Counting Your status as nothing

The \c{E}King of all kings came to serve

\c{G\s m}Washing my feet

\c{F\s }Covering me with Your \c{E}love
\ev

\bc
If \c{B}more of You means \c{B/D\s }less of me

Take \c{E}everything

Yes, \c{B}all of You is \c{B/D\s }all I need

Take \c{E}everything
\ec

\bv
\c{B}You are my life and my treasure

The \c{E}One that I can't live without

\c{G\s m}Here at Your feet

My des\c{F\s }ires and dreams I lay \c{E}down

\c{G\s m}Here at Your feet

My des\c{F\s }ires and dreams I lay \c{E}down

Oh \c{B}Lord, change me like only You \c{E}can

Here with my heart in Your \c{G\s m}hands

Father I pray make me \c{E}more like \c{F\s }Jesus

This \c{B}world is dying to know who You \c{E}are

You've shown us the way to Your \c{G\s m}heart

So Father I pray make me \c{E}more like \c{F\s }Jesus
