You \c{G}came to the world You created

\c{C}Trading Your crown for a cross

You \c{Em}willingly died

Your \c{D}innocent life paid the \c{C}cost
\ev

\bv
\c{G}Counting Your status as nothing

The \c{C}King of all kings came to serve

\c{Em}Washing my feet

\c{D}Covering me with Your \c{C}love
\ev

\bc
If \c{G}more of You means \c{G/B}less of me

Take \c{C}everything

Yes, \c{G}all of You is \c{G/B}all I need

Take \c{C}everything

\bv
\c{G}You are my life and my treasure

The \c{C}One that I can't live without

\c{Em}Here at Your feet

My des\c{D}ires and dreams I lay \c{C}down

\c{Em}Here at Your feet

My des\c{D}ires and dreams I lay \c{C}down

Oh \c{G}Lord, change me like only You \c{C}can

Here with my heart in Your \c{Em}hands

Father I pray make me \c{C}more like \c{D}Jesus

This \c{G}world is dying to know who You \c{C}are

You've shown us the way to Your \c{Em}heart

So Father I pray make me \c{C}more like \c{D}Jesus
