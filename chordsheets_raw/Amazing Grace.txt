<Verse 1>
A[C]mazing grace! How [F]sweet the [C]sound
That saved a [F]wretch; like [G]me
I [C]once was lost, but [F]now I'm [C]found
Was blind, but [F]now I [C]see

<Verse 2>
’Twas [C]grace that [Am]taught my [F]heart to [C]fear
And [Am]grace my [F]fears re[G]lieved
How [C]precious [Am]did that [F]grace ap[C]pear
The [Am]hour I [F]first be[C]lieved

<Verse 3>
The [C]Lord [G/B]hath [Am]promised [F]good to [C]me
[G/B]His [Am]word my [F]hope se[G]cures
He [C]will my [Am]shield and [F]portion [C]be
[G/B]As [Am]long as [F]life en[C]dures

<Verse 4>
When [C]we’ve [G/B]been [Am]there ten [F]thousand [C]years
[G/B]Bright [Am]shining [F]as the [G]sun
We’ve [C]no less [Am]days to [F]sing God’s [C]praise
[G/B]Than [Am]when we [F]first be[C]gun
