Chorus 1 (x2)

<Verse 1>
God sent His [A]Son, they called Him [D]Jesus;
He came to [A]love, heal and for[E]give; [E7]
He lived and [A]died [A7] to buy my [D]pardon,
An empty [A]grave is there to [E]prove my Savior [A]lives!

<Chorus 1>
[A]Because He lives[A7], I can face to[D]morrow,
Because He [A]lives, all fear is [E]gone;
Because I [A/E D A]know He holds the [D]future,
And life is [A]worth the living [E]just because He [A]lives!

<Verse 2>
How sweet to [A]hold a newborn [D]baby,
And feel the [A]pride and joy he [E]gives; [E7]
But greater st[A]ill [A7] the calm as[D]surance:
This child can [A]face uncertain [E]days because He [A] lives!

<Verse 3>
And then one [A]day, I'll cross the [D]river,
I'll fight life's f[A]inal war with [E]pain; [E7]
And then, as [A]death [A7] gives way to [D]vict'ry,
I'll see the [A]lights of glory [E]and I'll know He [A]lives!
