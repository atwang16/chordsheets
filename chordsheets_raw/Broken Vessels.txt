<Verse 1>
All these [Em]pieces
Broken and [G]scattered
In mercy [Em]gathered
Mended and [G]whole
Empty-[Em]handed
But not for[G]saken
I've been set[D] free
I've been set [Em]free[D]

<Prechorus 1>
A[C]mazing grace
How [D]sweet the sound
That [Em]saved a wretch like m[C]e
Oh, I [C]once was lost
But [D]now I'm found
Was [Em]blind but now I s[C]ee

<Chorus>
Oh I can see you [G]now[D]
Oh I can see the [Em]love in Your e[C]yes
Laying yourself [G]down[D]
Raising up the [Em]broken to l[C]ife

<Break 1>
| Em | G |

<Verse 2>
You take our [Em]failure
You take our [G]weakness
You set Your [Em]treasure
In jars of [G]clay
So take this [Em]heart, Lord
I'll be Your [G]vessel
The world to[D] see
Your life in [Em]me, [D]oh

Oh, I [G]once was lost
