<Intro>
| C | Am | F | G |

<Verse 1>
[C] My hope is built on nothing less
[F] Than Jesus' blood and [G]righteousness
[Am] I dare not trust the [C/G]sweetest frame
[F] But wholly [G]trust in Jesus' [C]name

<Chorus>
[C/E] Christ a[F]lone, [Am]corner[G]stone
[C/E]Weak made [F]strong in the [Am]Savior's [G]love
[C/E]Through the [F]storm, [Am]He is [G]Lord
Lord of [C]all

<Verse 2>
[C] When Darkness seems to hide His face
[F] I rest on His un[G]changing grace
[Am] In every high and [C/G]stormy gale
[F] My anchor [G]holds within[C] the veil
[F] My anchor [G]holds within[C] the veil

<Tag>
He is [Am]Lord
Lord of [F]all[G]

<Verse 3>
[C] When He shall come with trumpet sound
[F] Oh, may I then in [G]Him be found
[Am] Dressed in His righteous[C/G]ness alone
[F] Faultless [G]stand before[C] the throne
