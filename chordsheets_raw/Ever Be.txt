<Verse 1>
[D] Your love is devoted[Em] like a ring of solid g[G]old
Like a vow that is test[F#m]ed like a [A]covenant of o[D]ld
And Your love is endur[Em]ing through the winter r[G]ain
And beyond the horiz[F#m]on with [A]mercy for tod[G]ay

<Prechorus 1>
Faithful You have b[D]een and faithful you will [A]be
You pledge yourself to m[Em]e and it's why I sing

<Chorus>
Your [G]praise will ever be on my [D]lips, ever be on my lips
Your [Bm]praise will ever be on my [A]lips, ever be on my lips
Your [G]praise will ever be on my [D]lips, ever be on my lips
Your [Bm]praise will ever be on my [A]lips, ever be on my lips

<Verse 2>
[D] You Father the orphan[Em]
Your kindness makes us w[G]hole
And you shoulder our weakn[F#m]ess
And your [A]strength becomes our o[D]wn
Now you're making me like you[Em]
Clothing me in w[G]hite
Bringing beauty from ash[F#m]es
For [A]You will have Your b[G]ride

<Prechorus 2>
Free of all her g[D]uilt and rid of all her s[A]hame
And known by her true n[Em]ame and it's why I sing

<Bridge>
[D] You will be praised,[A] You will be praised
[Bm] With angels and saints we sing [G]worthy are You Lord
[D] You will be praised,[Em] You will be praised
[Bm] With angels and saints we sing [G]worthy are You Lord
