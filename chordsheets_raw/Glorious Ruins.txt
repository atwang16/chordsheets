<Verse 1>
When the [D]mountains fall
And the tempest r[A]oars You are [Bm]with me[G]
When cre[D]ation folds
Still my soul will s[A]oar on Your m[Bm]ercy

<Prechorus>
I'll w[G]alk through the fire
With my h[D]ead lifted high
And my s[Bm]pirit revived in Your s[A]tory
---
And I'll l[G]ook to the cross
As my f[Bm]ailure is lost
In the l[D]ight of Your glorious g[A]race

<Chorus>
So Let the ruins come to l[D]ife
In the beauty of Your N[G]ame
Rising up from the a[D]shes
God forever You r[A]eign
---
And my soul will find r[Bm]efuge
In the shadow of Your w[G]ings
I will love You fore[D]ver
And forever I'll s[A]ing

<Verse 2>
When the [D]world caves in
Still my hope will c[A]ling to Your p[Bm]romise[G]
Where my [D]courage ends
Let my heart find s[A]trength in Your p[Bm]resence
