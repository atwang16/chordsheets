<Intro>
| Bm G | D |

<Verse 1>
[Bm] Cre[G]ated from d[D]ust
[Bm] You [G]came and You [D]lived among us
[Bm] You [G]took on our f[D]rame
You walked in our p[Bm]ain
And now You’re [G]taking us h[D]igher

<Verse 2>
[Bm] You [G]stepped into t[D]ime
[Bm] You [G]laid down Your l[D]ife to save us
[Bm] You [G]took all our s[D]hame
On the cross it was l[Bm]aid
And now You’re [G]taking us h[D]igher

<Chorus 1>
We go from [Bm]glory to [G]glory to [D]glory
We’ll never be the s[Bm]ame
We’ll [G]never be the s[D]ame
We go from [Bm]glory to [G]glory to [D]glory
We’re forever c[Bm]hanged,
[G]Forever c[D]hanged

<Verse 3>
[Bm] You [G]call me Your f[D]riend
[Bm] Brought [G]into Your e[D]ndless kingdom
[Bm] By the [G]blood I was m[D]ade
No longer a s[Bm]lave
And now You’re [G]taking us h[D]igher

<Bridge>
[G] Until we reach that day
[D]Love conquers everyt[A]hing
We’ll cry an anthem singing [Bm]Holy, [A]Holy
[G] And when we see that day
[D]We’re standing face to f[A]ace
We’ll shout an anthem singing [Bm]Holy, [A]Holy

<Verse 4>
[Bm] You [G]took on the g[D]rave
[Bm] So [G]not even d[D]eath can shake us
[Bm] The [G]Victor has w[D]on
And Heaven has c[Bm]ome
And now You’re [G]taking us h[D]igher
And now You’re [G]taking us h[D]igher

<Chorus 2>
We go from [Bm]glory to [G]glory to [D]glory
We’ll never be the s[Bm]ame
We’ll [G]never be the s[D]ame
You take us [Bm]higher and [G]higher and [D]higher
We’re forever c[Bm]hanged,
[G]Forever c[D]hanged

<Chorus 3>
We go from [Bm]glory to [G]glory to [D]glory
We go from [Bm]glory to [G]glory to [D]glory
You take us [Bm]higher and [G]higher and [D]higher
We’re forever c[Bm]hanged,
[G]Forever c[D]hanged
