<Chorus 1>
[F]Go, tell it on the mountain, [C]over the hills and [F]everywhere;
[F]Go, tell it on the mountain that [F]Jesus [C]Christ is [F]born.

<Verse 1>
While [F]shephers kept their watching
O'er [C] silent flocks by [F]night,
Be[F]hold throughout the heavens
There [C]shone a Holy [C7]Light.

<Verse 2>
The [F]shepherds feared and trembled
When [C]lo! Above the [F]earth,
Rang [F]out the angel chorus
That [C]hailed our Savior's [C7]birth.

<Verse 3>
Down [F]in a lowly manger
the [C]humble Christ was [F]born
And [F]brought us God's salvation
That [C]blessed Christmas [C7]morn.
