<Intro>

<Verse 1>
[C] Amazing love
[F] That welcomes me
[C] The kindness of m[G]ercy
[C] That bought with blood
[F] Wholeheartedly
[Am] My soul undes[G]erving

<Chorus>
[C]God, you're so [G]good
God, you're so [C]good
[Am]God, you're so [F]good
You're so [C]good [G]to [C]me

<Verse 2>
[C] Behold the cross
[F] Age to age
[C] Hour by H[G]our
[C] The dead are raised
[F] The sinner saved
[Am] The work of your p[G]ower

<Bridge 1>
I am b[G]lessed
I am called
I am h[Am]ealed
I am whole
I am s[F]aved in Jesus' n[C]ame
Highly f[G]avored
Anointed
F[Am]illed with Your power
For the g[F]lory of Jesus' n[C]ame

<Bridge 2>
I am b[G]lessed
I am called
I am h[Am]ealed
I am whole
I am s[F]aved in Jesus' n[C]ame
Highly f[G]avored
Anointed
F[Am]illed with Your power
For the g[F]lory of Jesus' n[G]ame

<Verse 3>
[C] And should this life
[F] Bring suffering
[C] Lord, I will rem[G]ember
[Am] What Calvary
[F] Has bought for me
[C] Both now and fore[G]ver
