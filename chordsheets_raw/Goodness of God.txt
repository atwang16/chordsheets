<Verse 1>
I love You [Ab]Lord
Oh Your [Db]mercy never f[Ab]ails me
A[Eb/G]ll my [Fm]days 
I've been [Db]held in Your [Eb]hands
From the moment that I [Fm]wake up
[Db] Until I lay my [Ab]head [Eb/G] [Fm]
I will [Db]sing of the g[Eb]oodness of [Ab]God

<Chorus>
[Db] All my life You have been [Ab]faithful
[Db] All my life You have been [Ab]so, so [Eb]good
[Db] With every breath that I am [Ab]a[Eb/G]ble[Fm]
I will [Db]sing of the g[Eb]oodness of [Ab]God

<Verse 2>
I love Your [Ab]voice
You have [Db]led me through the f[Ab]ire
In d[Eb/G]arkest [Fm]nights
You are [Db]close like no o[Eb]ther
I've known You as a [Fm]father
[Db] I've known You as a [Ab]friend[Eb/G][Fm]
I have [Db]lived in the g[Eb]oodness of [Ab]God

<Bridge>
[Ab/C] Your goodness is [Db]running after, it's [Eb]running after m[Ab]e
[Ab/C] Your goodness is [Db]running after, it's [Eb]running after m[Ab]e
With my l[Ab/C]ife laid down, I'm surr[Db]endered now, I g[Eb]ive You everyt[Fm]hing
[Ab/C] Your goodness is [Db]running after, it's [Eb]running after m[Ab]e
