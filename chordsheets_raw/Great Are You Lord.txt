You give [D]life, You are [F#m]love
You bring [E]light to the darkness
You give [D]hope, You [F#m]restore
Every [E]heart that is broken
[D][F#m]Great are You, [E]Lord

It's Your [D]breath in our [F#m]lungs
So we [E]pour out our praise, we pour out our praise
It's Your [D]breath in our [F#m]lungs  
So we [E]pour out our praise to You only
