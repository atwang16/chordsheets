<Verse 1>
[G] I have heard a sound[Cmaj7] coming on the wind
[G] Changing hearts and minds,[Cmaj7] healing brokenness
[Em] I feel a generation[Cmaj7] breaking through despair
[Em] I hear a generation[Cmaj7] full of faith declare

<Prechorus>
[D] And our s[Em]ong, it will [C]be
[D] Out of the d[Em]arkness we will [C]rise and sing

<Chorus>
[G]He is faithful, [C]He is glorious
And [Em]He is Jesus and [C]all my hope is in Him
[G]He is freedom, [C]He is healing right now
[Em]He is hope and joy and [C]love and peace and life

<Verse 2>
[G] I have seen a light[Cmaj7] like the break of dawn
[G] Giving blind men sight,[Cmaj7] letting lame men walk
[Em] I see a generation[Cmaj7] with resurrection life
[Em] We are a generation[Cmaj7] filled with the power of Christ
