Verse 2
Chorus 2

<Verse 1>
I open up to You
This love that makes me new
Oh, may my heart receive
This love that carries me

<Chorus 1>
From the head to the heart
You take me on a journey
Of letting go and getting lost in You

<Verse 2>
My heart is open wide
I will receive your light
You give me faith like a child
In you my heart runs wild

<Chorus 2>
There’s no shame
In looking like a fool
When I give you what I can’t keep 
and take a hold of you
