[G] I am chosen, I am free

You set my feet on solid ground

Nothing's gonna hold me [C]back
[Em]Nothing's gonna hold me [D]back

My heart was f[D]ree
I'm al[Em]ive to live for you
I'm al[D]ive to live for you

You give e[Em]verything for me

The slate is clean; a brand new day

To claim this crown through Christ my own
