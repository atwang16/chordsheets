<Verse 1>
[C] There's nothing worth more
That could ever come c[Fmaj7]lose
No thing can compare
You're our living [C]hope
Your presence,[F]Lord

<Verse 2>
[C] I've tasted and seen
Of the sweetest of l[Fmaj7]oves
Where my heart becomes free
And my shame is un[C]done
Your presence, [F]Lord

<Chorus>
[C]Holy Spirit, You are welcome here
Come [Fmaj7]flood this place and fill the [Dm]atmosphere
Your [C]glory, God, is what our hearts long for
To be [Fmaj7]overcome by Your [Dm]presence, Lord[C]
Your presence, [Fmaj7]Lord

<Bridge>
[Fmaj7] Let us be[C/E]come more a[Dm]ware of Your [C/E]presence
[Fmaj7] Let us ex[C/E]perience the g[Dm]lory of Your [C/E]goodness
