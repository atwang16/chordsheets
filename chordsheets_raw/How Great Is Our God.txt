<Verse 1>
The [A]splendor of a king
[F#m7]Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rej[Dsus2]oice
All the earth rejoice

<Verse 2>
He w[A]raps Himself in light,
And d[F#m7]arkness tries to hide
And trembles at His v[Dsus2]oice
Trembles at His voice

<Chorus>
How g[A]reat is our God
Sing with m[E/G#]e
How [F#m7]great is our God
And all will [E]see
How [D2]great, how g[E]reat is our G[A]od

<Verse 3>
[A]Age to age He stands
And t[F#m7]ime is in His hands
Beginning and the e[Dsus2]nd
Beginning and the end

<Verse 4>
The G[A]odhead Three in One
[F#m7]Father, Spirit and Son
The Lion and the L[Dsus2]amb
The Lion and the L[E]amb

<Bridge>
[A]Name above all names[E/G#]
[F#m7]Worthy of all praise[E]
My [D2]heart will sing
How g[E]reat is our G[A]od

<Outro>
How g[A]reat is our God
Sing with m[E/G#]e
How [F#m7]great is our God
And all will [E]see
How [D2]great, how g[E]reat is our G[A]od
