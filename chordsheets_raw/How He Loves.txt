<Verse>
[C]He is jealous for me
[Am]Loves like a hurricane
I am a tree [G]bending beneath
The weight of His wind and [F]mercy
---
When [C]all of a sudden
I am unaware of these af[Am]flictions eclipsed by glory
And I [G]realize just how beautiful You are
And how [F]great Your affections are for me

<Chorus 1>
And [C]oh how He loves us [Am]so
Oh, how He [G]loves us
How He loves us [F]all

<Break>
| C | | Am | |

<Chorus 2>
He [C]loves us
Oh, how He [Am]loves us
Oh, how He [G]loves us
Oh, how He [F]loves

<Bridge>
And [C]we are His portion
And He is our prize
[Am]Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If His [G]grace is an ocean, we're all [F]sinking
---
When [C]heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
And my [Am]heart turns violently inside of my chest
I [G]don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I [F]think about the way that He loves us
