<Verse 1>
Oh kneel me [F#m]down a[E/G#]gain
[A] Here [B]at Your [E]feet
Show me how [F#m]much You [E/G#]love[A] hu[B]mili[E]ty
Oh Spirit [F#m]be the [E/G#]star[A] that [B]leads me [C#m]to
The humble [F#m]heart of love[B] I see in [E]You

<Chorus>
You are the G[A]od of the b[E/G#]roken
The [F#m]friend of the w[B]eak
You wash the f[A]eet of the w[E/G#]eary
Em[F#m]brace the ones in n[B]eed
---
I want to b[A]e like you J[E/G#]esus
To [F#m]have this heart in m[B]e
You are the G[F#m]od of the h[E/G#]umble
You a[A]re the h[B]umble K[E]ing

<Verse 2>
Here in the [F#m]dusty [E/G#]ground
[A] I [B]bow with [E]kings
Where wise men [F#m]laid be[E/G#]fore[A] their [B]offe[E]rings
I lay no [F#m]golden [E/G#]crown[A] here [B]at your [C#m]feet 
Just this my [F#m]broken life[B] I offer [E]thee
