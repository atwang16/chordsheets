<Chorus 1>
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

<Verse 1>
I've wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light 

<Verse 2>
Just like a blind man I wandered alone
Worries and fear I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man who God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light 

<Verse 3>
I was a fool to wander and stray
For straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

<Verse 4>
Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away

<Chorus 2>
I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah, by and by I'll fly away

<Verse 5>
When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away

<Verse 6>
Just a few more weary days, and then, I'll fly away
To a land where joys shall never end, I'll fly away
