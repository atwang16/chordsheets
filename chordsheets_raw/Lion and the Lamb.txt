<Verse 1>
He's [C]coming on the clouds
Kings and kingdoms [Dm]will bow [F]down
[Am]Every chain will break
As [G]broken hearts declare His [F]praise
For who can stop the [G]Lord almighty?

<Chorus>
[C] Our God is the Lion, the [G/B]Lion of [Am]Judah
Heâ€™s roaring with power and [G]fighting our b[F]attles
Every knee will [G]bow before Him
[C] Our God is the Lamb, the [G/B]Lamb that was [Am]slain
For the sins of the world, His [G]blood breaks the [F]chains
Every knee will [G]bow before the Lion and the [F]Lamb
Every knee will [G]bow before Him
