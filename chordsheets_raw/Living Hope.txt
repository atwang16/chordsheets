<Verse 1>
How great the [A]chasm that lay be[E]tween us
How high the [D]mountain[F#m] I could not [E]climb
In despe[A]ration, I turned to [E]heaven
And spoke Your [D]name in[E]to the n[A]ight
---
Then through the [D]darkness, Your loving [A]kindness
Tore through the [F#m]shadows of my [E]soul
The work is [A]finished, the end is [E]written
Jesus [D]Christ, my [E]living [A]hope

<Break>

<Verse 2>
Who could i[A]magine so great a [E]mercy?
What heart could [D]fathom[F#m] such boundless [E]grace?
The God of [A]ages stepped down from [E]glory
To wear my [D]sin and [E]bear my [A]shame
---
The cross has [D]spoken, I am for[A]given
The King of [F#m]kings calls me His [E]own
Beautiful [A]Savior, I'm Yours for[E]ever
Jesus [D]Christ, my [E]living [A]hope

<Chorus 1>
Halle[D]lu[A]jah, praise the [E]One who set me [F#m]free
Halle[D]lu[A]jah, death has [E]lost its grip on [F#m]me
You have [D]broken every [A]chain
There's sal[E]vation in Your [F#m]name
Jesus [D]Christ, my [E]living [A]hope

<Verse 3>
Then came the [A]morning that sealed the [E]promise
Your buried [D]body[F#m] began to [E]breathe
Out of the [A]silence, the Roaring [E]Lion
Declared the [D]grave has no [E]claim on [A]me

<Verse 4>
Then came the [A]morning that sealed the [E]promise
Your buried [D]body[F#m] began to [E]breathe
Out of the [A]silence, the Roaring [E]Lion
Declared the [D]grave has no [E]claim on [F#m]me
Jesus, [D]Yours is the [E]victo[A]ry

<Chorus 2>
Halle[D]lu[A]jah, praise the [E]One who set me [F#m]free
Halle[D]lu[A]jah, death has [E]lost its grip on [F#m]me
You have [D]broken every [A]chain
There's sal[E]vation in Your [F#m]name
Jesus [D]Christ, my [E]living [F#m]hope

<Outro>
Jesus [D]Christ, my [E]living [F#m]hope
Oh God, You [D]are my [E]living [A]hope
