Chorus (x2)

<Verse 1>
[C] I once was fatherless
[F2] A stranger with no hope
[C] Your kindness wakened me
A[F2]wakened me, from my sleep

<Verse 2>
[C] Your love it beckons deeply
[F2] A call to come and die
[Am7] By grace now I will come
And [F2]take this life, take your life

<Prechorus>
[Am] Sin has [G]lost its power
[F] Death has lost its sting
[Am] From the [G]grave you've risen
[F] victoriously

<Chorus>
[C] Into marvelous light I'm running
[F] Out of darkness out of shame
[Am] By the cross you [G]are the truth
You [F]are the life, you are the way[C]

<Verse 3>
[C] My dead heart now is beating
[F2] My deepest stains now clean
[C] Your breath fills up my lungs
[F2]Now I'm free. now I'm free

<Bridge>
[C] Lift my hands and spin around
[Fmaj7] See the light that I have found
[Am] Oh the [G]marvelous light
M[F]arvelous light
