[C] Everyone needs comp[G]assion
A love that's never f[Em]ailing

The kindness of a S[Em]aviour
The [D]hope of nations[C][D][C][D]

[G]Saviour, He can move the [D]mountains
My God is [C]mighty to s[G]ave, He is [Em]mighty to s[D]ave
For[G]ever, Author of Sal[D]vation
He rose and [C]conquered the g[G]rave
Jesus [Em]conquered the g[D]rave

And now [D]I surrender, I surrender[C][D][C][D]
