Chorus (x2)

<Intro>

<Verse 1>
You [Bb]came to the world You created
[Eb]Trading Your crown for a cross
You [Gm]willingly died
Your [F]innocent life paid the [Eb]cost

<Verse 2>
[Bb]Counting Your status as nothing
The [Eb]King of all kings came to serve
[Gm]Washing my feet
[F]Covering me with Your [Eb]love

<Chorus>
If [Bb]more of You means [Bb/D]less of me
Take [Eb]everything
Yes, [Bb]all of You is [Bb/D]all I need
Take [Eb]everything

<Verse 3>
[Bb]You are my life and my treasure
The [Eb]One that I can't live without
[Gm]Here at Your feet
My des[F]ires and dreams I lay [Eb]down
[Gm]Here at Your feet
My des[F]ires and dreams I lay [Eb]down

<Bridge>
Oh [Bb]Lord, change me like only You [Eb]can
Here with my heart in Your [Gm]hands
Father I pray make me [Eb]more like [F]Jesus
This [Bb]world is dying to know who You [Eb]are
You've shown us the way to Your [Gm]heart
So Father I pray make me [Eb]more like [F]Jesus

[Eb]More like [F]Jesus
