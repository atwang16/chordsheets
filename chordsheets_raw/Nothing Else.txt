<Intro>
|: Dm | F | C | :|

<Chorus>
I'm caught up in Your [Dm]presence
[F] I just want to [C]sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this [Dm]holy moment
[F] I never want to l[C]eave
---
Oh, I'm not here for [Dm]blessings
[F] Jesus, You don't [C]owe me anything
More than any[Dm]thing that You can d[F]o
I just want Y[C]ou

<Verse 1>
I'm s[F]orry when I've just gone through the motions
I'm s[C/E]orry when I just sang another song
Take me b[Fmaj7]ack to where we started
I open up my heart to Y[C]ou

<Verse 2>
I'm s[F]orry when I've come with my agenda
I'm s[C/E]orry when I forgot that You're enough
Take me b[Fmaj7]ack to where we started
I open up my heart to Y[C]ou

<Bridge>
I just want [Dm]You
Nothing else,[F] nothing else
[Am] Nothing else will d[G]o
