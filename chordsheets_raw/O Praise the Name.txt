Chorus

<Verse 1>
I cast my [C]mind to Calvary
Where Jesus [Gadd4]bled and died for [Am]me
I see His [F]wounds His hands His [C]feet
My Saviour [Gadd4]on that cursed [C]tree

<Verse 2>
His body [C]bound and drenched in tears
They laid Him [Gadd4]down in Joseph's [Am]tomb
The entrance [F]sealed by heavy [C/E]stone
Messiah [Gadd4]still and all a[C]lone

<Chorus>
O [C]praise the Name of the [F]Lord our [C]God
O [Am]praise His Name for[G]evermore
For [C/E]endless days we will [F]sing Your [Am]praise
Oh [F]Lord oh [G]Lord our [C] God

<Verse 3>
Then on the [C]third at break of dawn
The Son of [G]heaven rose a[Am]gain
O trampled [F]death where is your [C]sting?
The angels [G]roar for Christ the [C]King

<Verse 4>
He shall re[C]turn in robes of white
The blazing [G]sun shall pierce the [Am]night
And I will [F]rise among the [C]saints
My gaze trans[G]fixed on Jesus' [C]face

<Outro>
Oh [F]Lord oh [G]Lord our [C] God
