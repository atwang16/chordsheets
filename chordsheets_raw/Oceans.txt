| Bm7 / / A/C# | D | A | G |

<Verse 1>
[Bm] You call me out u[A/C#]pon the [D]waters
The great u[A]nknown where feet may [G]fail
[Bm] And there I find You [A/C#]in the [D]mystery
In oceans [A]deep, my faith will[G] stand

<Chorus>
[G] And I will [D]call upon Your [A]name
[G] And keep my [D]eyes above the [A]waves
When oceans [G]rise, my soul will [D]rest in Your em[A]brace
For I am [G]Yours and [A]You are [Bm]mine

<Break 1>

<Verse 2>
[Bm] Your grace abounds in [A/C#]deepest [D]waters
Your sovereign [A]hand will be my [G]guide
[Bm] Where feet may fail and [A/C#]fear sur[D]rounds me
You've never [A]failed and You won't start[G] now

[Bm] Spirit lead me where my t[G]rust is without borders
Let me w[D]alk upon the waters

In the p[A]resence of my Savior

<Bridge 2>
[G] Spirit lead me where my t[D]rust is without borders
Let me w[A]alk upon the waters
Where[Em]ver You would call me

In the p[Em]resence of my Savior

<Bridge 3>
[Bm] Spirit lead me w[A/C#]here my t[D]rust is without borders
Let me w[A]alk upon the waters

And my f[A]aith will be made stronger
In the p[Em]resence of my Savior
