<Intro>
|: G#m | F# | E | B :|

<Verse 1>
[G#m] Before I spoke a [F#]word, You were singing [E]over me
[G#m] You have been [F#]so, so good[E] to me
[G#m] Before I took a [F#]breath, You breathed Your [E]life in me
[G#m] You have been [F#]so, so kind[E] to me

<Chorus>
Oh, the [G#m]overwhelming, [F#]never-ending, [E]reckless love of G[B]od
Oh, it [G#m]chases me down, [F#]fights â€˜til I'm found, [E]leaves the ninety-n[B]ine
I couldn't e[G#m]arn it, I don't des[F#]erve it, still You [E]give Yourself aw[B]ay
Oh, the [G#m]overwhelming, [F#]never-ending, [E]reckless love of [B]God

<Break>
|: G#m | F# | E | B :|

<Verse 2>
[G#m] When I was Your [F#]foe, still Your love [E]fought for me
[G#m] You have been [F#]so, so good[E] to me
[G#m] When I felt no [F#]worth, You paid it [E]all for me
[G#m] You have been [F#]so, so kind[E] to me

<Bridge 1>
[G#m] There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

<Bridge 2>
[G#m] There's no shadow You won't [F#]light up
Mountain You won't [E]climb up
Coming after m[B]e
[G#m] There's no wall You won't [F#]kick down
Lie You won't [E]tear down
Coming after m[B]e
