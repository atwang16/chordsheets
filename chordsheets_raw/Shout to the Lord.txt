<Verse 1>
[C] My Jesus,[G] my Saviour
[Am]Lord there is n[G]one like Y[F]ou
All of my d[C/E]ays [F]I want to p[G]raise
The [Am]wonders of Your [A#]migh[F/A]ty [G]love

<Verse 2>
[C] My comfort,[G] my shelter
[Am]Tower of r[G]efuge and s[F]trength
Let every b[C/E]reath, [F]all that I a[G]m
[Am]Never cease to [A#]wor[F/A]ship [G]You

<Chorus>
[C]Shout to the L[Am]ord all the E[F]arth, let us s[G]ing
[C]Power and m[Am]ajesty, p[F]raise to the K[G]ing
[Am]Mountains bow down and the s[F]eas will roar
At the [G]sound [F]of Your [G]name
[C]I sing for j[Am]oy at the w[F]ork of Your h[G]and
For[C]ever I'll l[Am]ove You, fore[F]ver I'll s[G]tand
[Am]Nothing compares to the p[F]romise I h[G]ave
In [C]You
