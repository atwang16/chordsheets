<Verse 1>
[G]You stood before creation
E[C]ternity in Your hands
[G/B]You spoke the earth into m[Em]otion
My soul now[C] to stand

<Verse 2>
[G]You stood before my failure
And [C]carried the cross for my shame
My [G/B]sin weighed upon Your s[Em]houlders
My soul now[C] to stand

<Prechorus 1>
So what can I s[C]ay[Am]
And what could I d[Em]o
But offer this h[C]eart O God[D]
Completely to [Em]You

<Verse 3>
So [G]I'll walk upon salvation
Your [C]Spirit alive in me
This [G/B]life to declare Your p[Em]romise
My soul now[C] to stand

<Prechorus 2>
So what can I s[C]ay[Am]
And what could I d[Em]o
But offer this h[C]eart O God[D]
Completely to [C]You

<Chorus>
[C] I'll [G]stand
With [D]arms high and [Em]heart abandoned
[C] In [G]awe of the [D]One who [Em]gave it all
[C] I'll [G]stand
My [D]soul Lord to [Em]You surrendered
[C]All I a[G]m is Y[D]ours

<Prechorus 3>
So what can I s[C]ay[Am]
And what could I d[Em]o
But offer this h[C]eart O God[D]
Completely to [G]You
