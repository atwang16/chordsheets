<Intro>
| D | F#m | A | E |

<Verse 1>
[D] How I live for the moments
[F#m] Where I'm still in Your presence
[A] All the noise dies down
[E] Lord speak to [A/C#]me now

<Verse 2>
[D] You have all my attention
[F#m] I will linger and listen
[A] I can't miss a thing

<Prechorus>
[E] Lord I [A/C#]know my [D]heart wants more of You
My [F#m]heart wants something new
So [A]I surrender a[E]ll

<Chorus>
[A/C#]All I [D]want is to live within Your [E]love
Be undone by who You [F#m]are
My desire is to [A/C#]know You deeper
[D]Lord I will open up a[E]gain
Throw my fears into the [F#m]wind
I am desperate for a [A/C#]touch of heaven
[D]Oh[E][F#m][A/C#]

<Verse 3>
[D] You're the fire in the morning
[F#m] You're the cool in the evening
[A] The breath in my soul
[E] All the life in [A/C#]my bones

<Verse 4>
[D] There is no hesitation
[F#m] In Your love and affection
[A] It's the sweetest of all

<Bridge>
I open up my [D]heart to You
[E] I open up my [F#m]heart to You n[A/C#]ow
So do what only [D]You can
[E] Jesus have Your [F#m]way in me n[A/C#]ow
