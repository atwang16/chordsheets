Now re[G]vealed in [Bm]You our [A]Christ

<Chorus 1>
What a beautiful Name it [D]is
What a beautiful Name it [A]is
The Name of J[Bm]esus C[A]hrist my K[G]ing
What a beautiful Name it [D/F#]is
Nothing compares to t[A]his
What a beautiful Name it i[Bm]s
The N[A]ame of J[G]esus

<Verse 2>
[D] You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus, [G]You brought [Bm]heaven [A]down
[Bm] My sin was great, Your l[A/C#]ove was [D]greater
What could [G]sepa[Bm]rate us [A]now

<Chorus 2>
What a wonderful Name it [D]is
What a wonderful Name it [A]is
The Name of J[Bm]esus C[A]hrist my K[G]ing

Nothing compares to t[A]his
What a wonderful Name it i[Bm]s
The N[A]ame of J[G]esus

<Bridge 1>
Death could not h[G]old You, the veil tore bef[A]ore You
You silenced the b[Bm]oast, of sin and g[F#m]rave
The heavens are r[G]oaring, the praise of Your g[A]lory
For You are r[Bm]aised to life ag[A]ain

<Bridge 2>
You have no r[G]ival, You have no e[A]qual
Now and fore[Bm]ver, God You r[F#m]eign
Yours is the K[G]ingdom, Yours is the g[A]lory
Yours is the N[Bm]ame, above all n[A]ames

<Chorus 3>
What a powerful Name it [D]is
What a powerful Name it [A]is
The Name of J[Bm]esus C[A]hrist my K[G]ing
What a powerful Name it [D/F#]is
Nothing compares to t[A]his
What a powerful Name it i[Bm]s
The N[A]ame of J[G]esus
