<Verse 1>
What a [C]Sa[G]vior my Re[C6]dee[G]mer
Friend of [C]sin[G]ners one like[D] me
Oh what [C]kind[G]ness suffered [C]vio[G]lence
Healed my [Em]blind[G/D]ness and [D]set me[C] free

<Chorus>
Oh what [Em]grace I've [C]found in You my[G] Je[D]sus
That my [Em]soul should [C]entertain Your[G] great[D]ness
Should this [C]life hold [Em]nothing but my[G] Sav[D]ior
I will [C]praise [G]You al[D]ways

Heaven's [C]glo[G]ry clothed in [C6]mer[G]cy
Knew my [C]sto[G]ry yet took my[D] end
Oh what [C]free[G]dom hope like [C]hea[G]ven
Now for[Em]gi[G]ven I will [D]rise[C] again

I will [C]praise [G]You al[D]ways

<Bridge>
[C] Should this life I live
[D] Hold nothing but the [Em]cross where Jesus took my[G] shame
[C] Then with arms stretched wide
[D] And my hands held high
My [Em]every breath will sing a[G]gain
