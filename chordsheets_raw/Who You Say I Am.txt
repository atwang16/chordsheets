<Verse 1>
[F] Who am I that the highest King
Would [Dm]wel[C]come [F]me
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His [Dm]love [C]for [Bb]me
Oh His [Dm]love [C]for [Bb]me

<Chorus 1>
Who the [F]Son sets free
Oh is [C]free indeed
I’m a [Dm]child [C]of [Bb]God
Yes I [F]am

<Verse 2>
[F] Free at last He has ransomed me
His [Dm]grace [C]runs [F]deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus [Dm]died [C]for [Bb]me
Yes He [Dm]died [C]for [Bb]me

<Chorus 2>
Who the [F]Son sets free
Oh is [C]free indeed
I’m a [Dm]child [C]of [Bb]God
Yes I [F]am
In my [F]Father’s house
There’s a [C]place for me
I’m a [Dm]child [C]of [Bb]God
Yes I [F]am

<Bridge>
I am [Dm]chosen
Not [C/E]forsaken
I [F]am who You say I a[Bb]m
You are [Dm]for me
Not ag[C/E]ainst me
I [F]am who You say I a[Bb]m
