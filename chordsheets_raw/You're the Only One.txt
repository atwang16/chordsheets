<Verse 1>
Though the earth may try, to satisfy my heart
Though the earth may try, to tell me you're not faithful
Though the earth may try, to blind me from your goodness
You shine through...

<Chorus 1>
You're the only one who
Fills me up
You're the only one who
Fills me up
You're the only one who
Fills me up
You're the only one

<Chorus 2>
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one

<Verse 2>
Though the earth may try
Though the earth may try
Though the earth may tryThough the earth may try
