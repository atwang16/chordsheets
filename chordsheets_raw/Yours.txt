<Intro>

<Verse 1>
It all revolves around Your throne
Who can know your glory
So high above, Yet slain for us
You alone are worthy

<Chorus>
And the praise is yours
And the praise is yours
Youâ€™re the One we bow before
Reigning over us
As we lift you up
You will reign forevermore

<Verse 2>
The One who was and is to come
God of every moment
Forever crowned, Exalted now
You alone are holy

<Bridge>
Glory and praise
Power and strength
Worthy is the Lamb of God, Hallelujah

<Outro>
