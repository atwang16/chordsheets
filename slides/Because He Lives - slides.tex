God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus;

He came to love, heal and forgive; 

He lived and died  to buy my pardon,

An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,

Because He lives, all fear is gone;

Because I know He holds the future,

And life is worth the living just because He lives!

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,

And feel the pride and joy he gives; 

But greater still  the calm assurance:

This child can face uncertain days because He  lives!

And then one day, I'll cross the river,

I'll fight life's final war with pain; 

And then, as death  gives way to vict'ry,

I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!
