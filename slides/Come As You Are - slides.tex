Come out of sadness from wherever you've been

Come broken hearted let rescue begin

Come find your mercy oh sinner come kneel

Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal

Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal

So lay down your burdens lay down your shame

All who are broken lift up your face

Oh wanderer come home you're not too far

So lay down your hurt, lay down your heart

Come as you are

There's hope for the hopeless

And all those who've strayed

Come sit at the table come taste the grace

There's rest for the weary rest that endures

Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't cure
