I love You Lord

Oh Your mercy never fails me

All my days

I've been held in Your hands

From the moment that I wake up

 Until I lay my head  

I will sing of the goodness of God

I love Your voice

You have led me through the fire

In darkest nights

You are close like no other

I've known You as a father

 I've known You as a friend

I have lived in the goodness of God
