He's coming on the clouds

Kings and kingdoms will bow down

Every chain will break

As broken hearts declare His praise

For who can stop the Lord almighty?

 Our God is the Lion, the Lion of Judah

He’s roaring with power and fighting our battles

Every knee will bow before Him

 Our God is the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain

For the sins of the world, His blood breaks the chains

Every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb

Every knee will bow before Him

Open up the gates

Make way before the King of Kings

The God who comes to save

Is here to set the captives free

For who can stop the Lord almighty?
