 I lay my life down at Your feet

 'Cause You're the only One I need

 I turn to You and You are always there

 In troubled times it's You I seek

 I put You first that's all I need

 I humble all I am all to You

 Every how and every where

 You will never ever change

 Yesterday today the same

 Forever 'til forever meets no end
