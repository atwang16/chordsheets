 Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me

 You have been so, so good to me

 Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me

 You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights ‘til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it, still You give Yourself away

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

 When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me

 You have been so, so good to me

 When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me

 You have been so, so kind to me

 There's no shadow You won't light up

Mountain You won't climb up

Coming after me

There's no wall You won't kick down

Lie You won't tear down

Coming after me
